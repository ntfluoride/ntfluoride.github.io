<h1>Theoretical Digest #1: June 10th, 2019</h1>
<h2>"Open For Business"</h2>
This past weekend has brought many new changes to Theoretical City, breathing new life into the near-ghost town... city. The district of Levin, located north of Downtown, has opened to the public and a couple citizens have begun building their businesses. An impressive amount of terraforming has been done to both the Levin area and Downtown. Speaking of Downtown, public pools have opened where the farm used to be located. Yes, you can float up to the heavens by the blissful bubbles of the soul sand floored water or possibly drown to death in the magma pool, it's up to you. Another new addition to the Downtown area is the courthouse, built by Swingin30 (who also helped with terraforming). We can finally have Judge Polygon rule with an iron golem fist again. Finally, Town Hall is having offices built for the secretaries of the government. The Mayor's office will come at a later time.

<h1>Theoretical Digest #2: June 30th, 2019</h1>
<h2>"The Office(s)"</h2>
It's been a good twenty days before we've had an update on the city, but here we are at the end of June. It's hard to believe that we're over halfway done with 2019... and the server has been running for two months straight! Insane, I say! Anyway, progress, yes. The offices in Town Hall are finished, along with the Theoretical Money Machine (which is located where the restroom used to be). TMM functions both as a fee-free ATM and an emerald exchange center. More roads have been paved, so less ugly cobble roads! All the way North on Main Street and on the left of the way to Nevgo Station, City Manager Victor Tran is finally building the millionth version of theSupermarket. We wish him luck with his business, as well as every other business owner in Theoretical City.

<h2>"So, Ain't The End"</h2>
As of September 18th, 2019, bits & Bytes Minecraft 4 will be discontinued and eventually replaced by a new, less-limited world. It's been an iffy run to be perfectly honest, but the concept wasn't bad. Execution is key and sadly it didn't turn out right on this attempt. Maybe in the future we can try it again and stay on top of progress. For now though, we can enjoy something that we know works. It wasn't all for nothing, there's always lessons to be learned. Thank you to those who gave it a shot and didn't turn your nose up to just the idea of the server. Now, let's go do epic gaming, epic gamers!

Don't worry, I hated that last sentence too.-->
