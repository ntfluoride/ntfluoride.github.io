<h1>bits & Bytes Minecraft</h1>

<h2>bits & Bytes Vanilla (bnbmc1)</h2>
Launched: December 15th, 2017

<br>

Defunct: January 3rd, 2018

<h3>Beginnings</h3>
Everything started in a desert near spawn. A building named the "bits and Bytes Bed and Breakfast" was created, which was originally meant to house everyone. The only person who lived outside of the "bnbbnb" at the time was Squid Grill, who was creating the first incarnation of the Squid Apartments. It wasn't until later that The Pixel Polygon would finally join the server, as he was just messing in the console instead of playing on the world due to time.

&nbsp;

<h3>Whale City</h3>
However, soon after, people started branching out into an area that would eventually become known as Whale City. This was essentially the capital of the server, however, its population got lower and lower because everyone was creating their own towns. 

&nbsp;

<h3>Vehicles</h3>
One day, The Pixel Polygon wanted to add cars to the game, so he decided to attempt to use Car Traffic Generator on the server. However, this method turned out to not work well on servers due to command changes in Spigot. This resulted in the vehicles plugin being added to the server. 

&nbsp;

<h3>Shutdown</h3>
On Dec 29, 2017, in lieu of bits & Modded Blocks, along with the declining user base, it was announced that the server would shut down. For a time, it was actually shut down. It came back on December 31, 2017, however, after people voted the server should be back up, along with complaints that the modded server was taking up too much RAM due the increase in the amount of mods. The vanilla server still didn't last very long, as it was shut down again and permanently on Jan 3, 2018 due to continued inactivity. An archive video was created a month later to show off the server to the public, and a world download was released for singleplayer use. 

&nbsp;

<h3>Revival</h3>
Shortly after bits & Bytes Minecraft was shut down due to its rapid development, The Pixel Polygon had an idea of reviving the original server as early as August 7, 2018. The original idea was to have 2 hints to the server's IP address, one as a channel disguised like an invalid channel on The Pixel Polygon's server "PPC." Another hint was to hide the IP in plain sight in Project: Aren episode 7. Attention for the server sparked shortly after Michael leaked the IP address to Neptunium Fluoride, to the point where more people were interested in playing. The IP was then officially revealed.

<br>
<br>

Due to the amount of structures built in creative mode, the "Change Hut" was created (a loose reference to the Warp Zone found in Super Mario Bros.) allowing the player to switch between Survival mode and Creative mode.

&nbsp;

<h3>Technical Information</h3>
The server ran on Spigot and was hosted on Google Cloud. A bucket was created to backup the world, though the script that was supposed to run every so often didn't work, and had to be run manually to ensure that the server would be backed up. A backup had to be restored only once in the server's lifetime due to a glitch in the resource pack "Car Traffic Generator" which doesn't allow it to work on servers. A separate Discord server was created to notify users of possible downtime due to maintenance.

<br>
<br>

For the revival, the server's files from the old server were migrated to Amazon Web Services under the EC2 t2.micro plan (though it was a happy accident, since the original plan was to use the singleplayer world as the main world), but no separate Discord server was created. Like bits and Bytes Minecraft, it used DiscordSRV to bridge the Discord server chat with the Minecraft server chat. After having experienced numerous server crashes, it was then decided that the server moved to Microsoft Azure, even if it meant having to switch to a paid platform.</p>

<h2>bits & Bytes Minecraft 2 (bnbmc2)</h2>
Launched: 2018

<br>

Defunct: 2018

    <h3>History</h3>
    "bnbmc2" was created on [insert date here] as a successor to the original bits and Bytes Vanilla with the same concept. The main difference is that even staff members could not use creative mode. The server was eventually shut down, it was briefly overtaken by the modded server, but the modded server also eventually shut down as well.

    &nbsp;

    <h3>Cities</h3>

    <h4>Sunflower City</h4>
    Sunflower City was the first city ever created in the server. It was at the spawn of the server and from the beginning, until the end, it was the biggest city in the server. It had a population of about 5. It was home to the headquarters of Squiiagco, Wal-nut, Dundermifflin, and other companies.
    
    <br>
    <br>

    The mayor of Sunflower City was not clear at first, because it did not have a government. It was originally thought by Squiddy that the mayor was Neptunium Fluoride but eventually Squiddy became the mayor. The government was made up by the residents of the city mainly.

    <br>
    <br>

    The city also had its own metro system with 3 stations, with more being built later on, and future development was planned using zoning. Though, the mayor disagreed with the zoning plan.

    <h4>Inkytown</h4>
    Inkytown was the second-largest city in the SFC-Inkytown area. It had a population of 2 and was located about 20 meters from Sunflower City. The city's limits were shown by a giant fence. It had a SQTR and an AirCS station.
    
    <h4>Whale City</h4>
    Whale City was a tiny town about 60 meters away from Sunflower City. It had a population of 1.
    
    <h4>Veronaville</h4>

    <h4>Contemporary Valley</h4>
    Information coming soon!

    &nbsp;

    <h3>Transportation</h3>
    The SFC-Inkytown area had many options for transportation.

    &nbsp;

    <h4>The Highway</h4>
    Built by Right Angle and owned by Wal-nut, the highway went to every city in the SFC-Inkytown area.
    
    <h4>The SQTR System</h4>
    The SQTR is a railroad built by Squiddy and had a partnership with Victor, it provided transportation to every city in the SFC-Inkytown area. Most stations were sub-par (compared to AirCS) but it provided safe and reliable transportation and a way to ship cargo. There were also plans to build a "Bullet Boat" system to dethrone the AirCS in long distance transport and revolutionize travel.
    
    <br>
    <br>
    
    The SQTR System used a potential glitch/feature that allowed boats driving on ice to go 144km/h, allowing people to theoretically get to Contemporary Valley, for example, in 15 seconds, compared to a normal railroad's max speed, 30 km/h. SQTR stands for "Squid Transit".

    &nbsp;
    
    <h4>AirCS</h4>
    The AirCS was built by ThePixelPolygon in response to the SQTR system and was meant to be a public service that wasn't owned by a corporation that anyone could work on. It was meant as a "sequel" to the original AirCS built in bits & Bytes Vanilla. The main difference is that the AirCS provided long distance travel options as well, to places like Contemporary Valley. Its development process was documented in ThePixelPolygon's video series Project: Aren, named after AirCS's original creator, Aren.

    <h3>Technical Information</h3>
    The server was hosted in Australia using DigitalOcean, but had very little RAM in the first few weeks of its life. After members have complained that the server was constantly lagging due to the lack of RAM, the maximum memory allocation was eventually increased.</p>
